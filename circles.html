                <div class="content">
                    <p>Mac Miller's album, <span class="grey">Circles</span>, is the second part of an amazing conceptual double album 
                        that Mac was in the process of creating. <span class="grey">Circles</span>, in my opinion, is the embodiement 
                        of <span class="pink">vulnerability</span>. It was Malcolm's way of saying to the world, <span class="pink">"HERE I AM"</span>.
                        As <span class="blue">Swimming</span> was the beckon, <span class="grey">Circles</span> was the answer, or echo to the never ending cycle of 
                        <span class="pink">life</span>.  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This piece of <span class="pink">art</span> spoke to me with its sense of experimentation and Malcom's haunting vocals. It almost felt like 
                        Mac was talking to me from the <span class="grey">"other side"</span> and telling me to keep on keepin on. I rated this art 12 out of 10 
                        because I am <span class="pink">biased</span> and I don't care much for <span class="grey">structure</span>. I've also <span class="blue">cried</span> to the album at least 3 times so I felt that 12 out of 10 was more
                        than appropriate.
