                    <p><span class="blue">Swimming</span> is the first part of a conceptual <span class="grey">circle</span> 
                        of <span class="pink">art</span>. The album's opening track sets the <span class="blue">tone</span> AND
                        <span class="pink">stage</span> for what would be Malcolm's return to <span class="grey">Earth</span>.
                        In my opinion, this is Mac facing his <span class="pink">innerself</span> through <span class="blue">reflection</span>
                        and at times, <span class="grey">rumination</span>. Mac's <span class="pink">smooth</span> fusion
                        of <span class="blue">funk</span> and hip-pop, create a mesh of wonderful tones for anyone to listen to.

                        <br>
                        <span class="blue">Swimming</span> is my favorite album, beating out Chano's <span class="pink">ACID RAP</span>.
                        Mac realeased this album at the most perfect time in my life, where I was at the same point of
                        <span class="blue">reflection</span>/<span class="grey">rumination</span>. This piece of art was 
                        so profound that it made me <span class="blue">rethink</span> my opinion on Malcolm's earlier work and go 
                        back to actually listen to what he had to say. I have <span class="blue">cried</span> to this wonderful piece of art
                        more times than I can count on my hand, so I believe a very biased 22 out of 10 rating is well deserved.
