                <h2>Hello! My name is Marcos Bravo,</h2>
                <p class="excerpt">Welcome to my SWIMMIN IN CIRCLES Web Project. <br>
                    I am a big MAC MILLER fan and decided to create this <br>
                    Piece of work to outline some of my opinions on his late <br>
                    Work. I wasn't always a fan of Eazy Mac And his Cheezy <br>
                    Raps, but after The Divine Feminine, he began to make me <br>
                    Question myself. In the midst of a long fight with depression <br>
                    And Life in general I realized that Mac and I had some <br>
                    Similarities in our fears of living life... I think I spent SO<br>
                    Much Time thinking about what happens After, that I forgot <br>
                    To live in what I have Now. I also struggled with addiction <br>
                    Like Malcolm did and his music made me feel not Alone. <br>
                    I hope this project gave you some more insight in Who I <br>
                    Am as a person and that you enjoyed peering into my mind.
