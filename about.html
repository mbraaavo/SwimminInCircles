                    <p class="excerpt">Welcome to my SWIMMIN IN CIRCLES Web Project.
                        I am a MAC MILLER fan and decided to create this 
                        Piece of work to outline some of my opinions on his late 
                        Work. I wasn't always a fan of Eazy Mac And his Cheezy 
                        Raps, but after The Divine Feminine, he began to make me 
                        Question myself. In the midst of a long fight with Depression 
                        and Life in general, I realized that Mac and I had some
                        Similarities in our Fears of living life... I think I spent SO
                        Much Time thinking about what happens After, that I Forgot 
                        to live in what I have Now. I also struggled with Addiction 
                        like Malcolm did and his Music made me feel not so Alone. 
                        I hope this project gave you some more insight in Who I 
                        am as a person and that you enjoyed Peering into my mind.
